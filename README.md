## Project Topic

_Add a sentence or two about the scope of your topic_
Our goal is to build an analytical tool for travel/departure time with variable/selectable airports/airlines.

## Rationale 

_Add a paragraph or two describing why this data is interesting or relevant to you and your audience. What do you want you audience to take away. Are there questions you're trying to answer? Note: this section is likely to change as you work with your data, but it's helpful to have an idea at this point._

Nobody likes long flights or unreliable airlines, so we wanted to build a tool that quickly displays data related to travel time that allows users to gain an overview of how each stacks up. We want our tool to do the following:

- Display duration of travel(air) time per airline from one given airport to another
- Display historical trends of travel time by selectable airline/airport
- Display summary statistics of relevant metrics

## Data Sets

Add a brief description of each of the data sources you will be using. Add links or screenshots where possible.

## Project Track & Stack

Describe which category your final result will fit into. It's okay to be creative and diverge a bit, so let us know if that is the case.
1. Creative d3 viz
1. Use Libraries like plotly or leaflet to build multiple view of your data source
1. Interative dashboard that builds multiple views from the same data
1. ETL or Data processing on a Python server (must still have visualizations and interaction but they can be simpler than other projects) 

What stack components are you going for?
1. Back-end API server? no
1. Scraping script? no
1. ETL Script? CSV - Python - Database
1. Database? What kind? Mongo(primary goal) OR Sqlite(secondary choice) 
1. Front-end compenents html/css/js (Required) all 3
1. How will you deploy the project? github pages
